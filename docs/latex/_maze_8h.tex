\subsection*{Classes}
\begin{DoxyCompactItemize}
\item 
struct \mbox{\hyperlink{struct_list_info}{List\+Info}}
\begin{DoxyCompactList}\small\item\em Define data structure that contain information for each nodes such as cost to go, distance to target, current node location and parent node location. \end{DoxyCompactList}\item 
class \mbox{\hyperlink{class_maze}{Maze}}
\begin{DoxyCompactList}\small\item\em The \mbox{\hyperlink{class_maze}{Maze}} class contains the search based A$\ast$ navigation algorithm for solving our path finding problem. The algorithm accepts a start position and goal position and finds a shortest path. The complexity of our algorithm is O(log n) because we use only one for loop to iterate through entries of priority list\+\_\+. The algorithm finds the shortest path very quick. \end{DoxyCompactList}\end{DoxyCompactItemize}
